# Project Management

This document contains rules and guidelines with how we want to handle this project.
Take note that we may often use Github terminologies here, like issues, milestones,
and iterations.

## Status

Our board has several status that includes:

1. **Untriaged**: The issue is a draft and needs more details.

## Epic

We are not using Github Milestones since our epics may span different repositories.
Our epics are Github draft issues (yeah, I know... it's dumb) with task lists referring
to existing issues under the epic.

Also, you may have noticed we have a non-draft milestone. That was a mistake on my end.
Don't do that again.
